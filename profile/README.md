## ü§î What is this?
This is a GitHub organization for Minecraft related freelancing plugins created by BillyDotWS (CookieBilly). This repository acts as an archive of projects that I have worked on. It also allows clients to view and actively track the code.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è A plugin you created for me needs updating/fixing!
If you have purchased within the previous 30 days, please message me using the method you originally contacted me (Fiverr, Discord ticket, Discord messages). If it's been more than 30 days, still contact me. But I may ask for extra compensation (or refuse to help), as this is a hobby and I may not have plenty of free time!

## üñ•Ô∏è How can I get a plugin?
I'm currently accepting commission requests! Feel free to message me on Discord with all of your project's requirements: CookieBilly#1348. I may not be able to offer my services for a variety of reasons: I have a full time job and this is just a hobby.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ I only see one plugin!
This is because most of the plugins I create here are private. You will see any repositories you have been invited to. I have around 60 projects within this organization! I may publish more publicly at some point in the future!
